- Attempted to re-create a [[Turnkey MVS]] VM
	- re-attempt of  [[Sep 1st, 2025]]
	- Why a re-attempt?
		- VirtualBox was crashing regularly
		- VirtualBox VM was running hot the entire time
	- What I did
		- Follow the instructions:

				  logseq.order-list-type:: number
					- this includes everything; including the Hercules emulator
					  logseq.order-list-type:: number
			- Unzip it
			  logseq.order-list-type:: number
			- prep it:
			  logseq.order-list-type:: number
			  ```
			  $ cd mvs-tk5
			  $ chmod -R +x *
			  $ ( cd unattended && ./set-console-mode )
			  ```
			- and launch it:

				- ```
				  $ ./mvs
