- A COBOL program has the following structure:
	- [[COBOL/Division/Identification]]
	- [[COBOL/Division/Environment]]
	- [[COBOL/Division/Data]]
	- [[COBOL/Division/Procedure]]
- Each line of COBOL is broken into these areas:
	- ```

- created
	- at IBM
	- by [[CODASYL]]
		- advised by Grace Hopper
	- to address the spiraling costs of creating and translating programs.

- motivations
	- current programming languages are make/model-dependent.
	- data processing systems needed to adapt to rapidly change and expanding requirements
	- the current languages require significantly experienced staff to make those changes
