- A COBOL program has the following structure:
	- [[COBOL/Identification Division]]
	- [[COBOL/Environment Division]]
	- [[COBOL/Data Division]]
	- [[COBOL/Procedure Division]]
- Each line of COBOL is broken into five areas:

	  Area  :   A Area (8-11)                                                   Area (73-80)
	  (1-6) :
	        Indicator
	        Area
	        (7)
	  ```
	- That is:
		- Sequence Number Area (1-6) —
		- Indicator Area (7)
			- `*` = line is a comment
			- `D` = line is a debug statement
			- `-` = line continuation
			- `/` = source formatter
		- A Area (8-11) — structure definition divisions, sections, level indicators
		- B Area (12-72) — statements, sentences, and clauses
		- Identification Area (73-80) — ignored by the compiler (can use for comments)

- # About
  collapsed:: true
	- ## Created
		- at IBM
		- by [[CODASYL]]
			- advised by Grace Hopper
		- to address the spiraling costs of creating and translating programs.

	- ## Motivations
		- current programming languages are make/model-dependent.
		- data processing systems needed to adapt to rapidly change and expanding requirements
		- the current languages require significantly experienced staff to make those changes
	- ## Timeline
		- 1959
		- 1960 — COBOL-60
		- ...
		- 2023 — COBOL-2023
