- generally implemented using high-speed circuit elements
- physically close to the ALU and CPU
	- to minimize delays
- can be used in
	- arithmetic operations (as accumulators)
	- shift operations (as shift registers)
	- addressing memory
		- a "base" register (as an operand in an instruction) points to a location in memory
		- a "displacement" (another operand in an instruction) describes an offset from the base address.
- addressed in 4 bits
