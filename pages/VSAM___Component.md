- A part of a VSAM Data Set.
	- Each data set type has the appropriate components
		- [[Data Set/Type/VSAM/Key-Sequenced (KSDS)]] and [[Data Set/Type/VSAM/Variable-length Relative Record (VRRDS)]] include an ((6877d550-1374-4f20-9c13-05dab5bc7793))
		- the sequential-ish data sets have [[component/Data]]s only
			- [[Data Set/Type/VSAM/Entry-Sequenced (ESDS)]]
			- [[Data Set/Type/VSAM/Relative Record (RRDS)]]
			- [[Data Set/Type/VSAM/Linear (LDS)]]
- Each component has its own
	- name
	- entry in the [[Catalog]]
	- entry in the [[VTOC]]
- there are two kinds of components:
	- [[VSAM/Component/Data]]
	-
	- ### index component
	  id:: 6877d550-1374-4f20-9c13-05dab5bc7793
		- collection of [[VSAM/Logical Record]]s
		- contains
			- the ((687664a2-e8a0-4c13-bc1e-64add9b7ff55))s
			- and the ((687664aa-f465-4c56-860c-eaf22bf31e25))s
			- of the logical records that contain those keys
		- these indexes are in a B-Tree like structure
