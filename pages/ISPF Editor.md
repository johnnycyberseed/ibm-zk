- ## Tips
	- When editing a member of a PDS, the command `EDIT XYZ` will attempt to edit the member named `XYZ` in the same PDS.
		- this pushes the current editing session on a stack; when you finish that edit, you return to the current one.
	- `F2` to use [[ISPF/Split Screen]]
		- this allows you to toggle back-and-forth between edit session.
