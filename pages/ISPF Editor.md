- ## Common Commands
	- `COLS ON` — turns on the line ruler
		- useful for writing well-formed listings
	- `HILITE` — manage syntax highlighting
	- `EDIT` — opens another instance of the editor
		- without an operand, it's like spawning another `=2` ([[ISPF/Edit Entry Panel]])
-
- ## Tips
	- When editing a member of a PDS, the command `EDIT XYZ` will attempt to edit the member named `XYZ` in the same PDS.
		- this pushes the current editing session in a stack.
	- `F2` to use [[ISPF/Split Screen]]
