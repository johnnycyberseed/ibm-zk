- There are two major parts of VSAM
	- Catalog Management
		- Q: how is this different than the z/OS "Catalog"?
		-
	- Record Management
		- see [[Data Set/Type/VSAM]] for Data Set types provided by VSAM

	- TL;DR. VSAM automates a lot of the nitty gritty
		- geometry of physical hardware (especially the 3390 disk drive)
		- writes "channel programs" in memory (called Virtual Channel Programs) which are micro-instructions for hardware while reading or writing.
		- supports an automatic WAIT on your task when you _must_ know when an I/O operation is completed.
- # Key Concepts
	- ## Alternate Indexes (AIX)
	  id:: 6877db4d-218c-4736-ad77-e66f253d84df
		- a [[Data Set/Type/VSAM/Key-Sequenced (KSDS)]] [[VSAM/Cluster]]
			- contains a  [[VSAM/Component/Index]] and [[VSAM/Component/Data]]
			- allowing
				- logical records of a [[Data Set/Type/VSAM/Key-Sequenced (KSDS)]] or [[Data Set/Type/VSAM/Entry-Sequenced (ESDS)]] [[VSAM/Cluster]]
			- to be accessed sequentially by more than one key field.
		- Can use the [[utility/IDCAMS]] to define and create an AIX.
			- by including the ((6877de3f-7502-4fe4-b15d-2373eaf086f6)) command
		- Before you can access such data sets via their alternate indexes, a path must be defined in the catalog
			- this is done through the [[utility/IDCAMS]]'s ((6877df4d-343a-4b81-b943-3600c5e8183f)) command

	- ## Sphere
		- is
			- a base [[VSAM/Cluster]]  and
			- all of its associated ((6877db4d-218c-4736-ad77-e66f253d84df))s.
