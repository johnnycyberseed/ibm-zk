- There are two major parts of VSAM
	- Catalog Management
		- Q: how is this different than the z/OS "Catalog"?
		-
	- Record Management
	-
- # Key Concepts
	- Logical Record
		- identified in one of three ways:
			- key field (the logical primary key)
				- can be up to 255 bytes in length
				- must be unique across the data set
				- There's also a secondary key or alternate key
					- does not need to be unique
			- Relative Byte Address (RBA) — bytes from the beginning of the data set to the start of the record
			- Relative Record Number (RRN) — the index (zero-based) of the record; the 4th record has an RRN of 3.

	- Physical Record
		- aka "Block"
	- Control Interval (CI)
		- can range from 512b

	- TL;DR. VSAM automates a lot of the nitty gritty
		- geometry of physical hardware (especially the 3390 disk drive)
		- writes "channel programs" in memory (called Virtual Channel Programs) which are micro-instructions for hardware while reading or writing.
		- supports an automatic WAIT on your task when you _must_ know when an I/O operation is completed.
