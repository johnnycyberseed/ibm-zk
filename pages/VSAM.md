	- TL;DR. VSAM automates a lot of the nitty gritty
		- geometry of physical hardware (especially the 3390 disk drive)
		- writes "channel programs" in memory (called Virtual Channel Programs) which are micro-instructions for hardware while reading or writing.
		- supports an automatic WAIT on your task when you _must_ know when an I/O operation is completed.
