- a variable within a [[COBOL]] program that is comprised of [[condition-name (88)]] values.
- aka "level-88 item" (when referring to the variable _and_ it's [[condition-name (88)]]s)
- analogous to the "enumeration" or "enum" type in other languages.
	- diff: enums typically have a single value per named condition; in [[COBOL]], a [[condition-name (88)]] can specify multiple values and range of values.
