- a [[Data Set/Type/Partitioned Data Set (PDS)]] that specifically contains [[object module]]s
-
- Examples:
	- [[AmHat]] `&SYSUID.LOADLIB.CUR`
		- yeah, it's a common confusion that a PDS named "LOAD" would contain "load modules" when in fact it contains [[FB80]] and is an "object library"
		- the trick is to view the organization:
			- [[FB80]]? it's likely "object deck" files (compiled, but not linked)
			- U0 (Undefined org)? it's almost certainly a complied _and_ linked executable program module.
