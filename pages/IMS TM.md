- IMS Transaction Manager
- a message-based transaction processor
	- processes messages
		- received from the terminal network (input)
		- created by application programs (output)
	- a queueing mechanism for handling those messages
- messages are processed asynchronously
	- but there is a facility for synchronous processing (APPC)
- IMS Connect
- IMS Control Region
	- up to 4000 applications in parallel
	-
- IMS Dependent Region

- Messages
	- each has an identifier
- Message Types
	- Transactions — payload is data intended for an underlying program to process
		-
	- Commands — for IMS itself to process
		- usually sent by system programmers
		- e.g. query system status
		-
	- APPC — for synchronous processing
- Message processing
	- message is received by [[IMS TM/OTMA]]
	- it hands the message to the [[IMS TM/Queue Manager]]
