- IMS Transaction Manager
- Plays the role of "Application Server"
- a message-based transaction processor
	- processes messages
		- received from the terminal network (input)
		- created by application programs (output)
	- a queueing mechanism for handling those messages
- messages are processed asynchronously
	- but there is a facility for synchronous processing (APPC)
- Can process over 100,000 transactions per second
-
- ## Runtime Architecture
	- IMS Control Region
		- up to 4000 applications in parallel
		- routes requests into
	- IMS Dependent Region
		- a place where applications can be run
		-
- Messages
	- each has an identifier
- Message Types
	- Transactions — payload is data intended for an underlying program to process
		-
	- Commands — for IMS itself to process
		- usually sent by system programmers
		- e.g. query system status
		-
	- APPC — for synchronous processing
-
- Message processing
	- outside systems send messages
		- by API
		- by TCP/IP
			- via [[IMS Connect]]
	- message is received by [[IMS TM/OTMA]]
	- it hands the message to the [[IMS TM/Queue Manager]]
	- the [[IMS TM/Scheduler]] services that queue
		- determines which dependent region the target application lives
		- activates that application and points it to the message in the queue
	- the application wakes, de-queues the message and processes it
