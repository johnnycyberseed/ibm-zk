- As the name suggests, can solve many different kinds of problems
	- in contrast with older computers that were built for specific purposes
- Main Elements
	- CPU
		- conceptually,
			- has an instruction set
				- Instruction is:
					- Operation code
					- Operands
				- when executed, gives:

					- condition code (stored in the [[status register]])
				- generally come in the following classes:
					- A
			- has a set of objects/entities (that are manipulated by instructions)
				- registers
				- memory
				- [[program status word]]
					- the combination of:
						- the [[status register]]
						- the [[program counter]]
				- storage key
				- channels
		- implementationally,
			- instruction fetching unit
			- instruction execution unit
			- cache
			- control unit

	- Memory
	- I/O subsystem
