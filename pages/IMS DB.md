- IMS Database Manager
- Presents a hierarchical database model to users
- Features
	- backup/recovery of database
- # The Data Model of a Database
	- Defined in a [[IMS/DBD]]
	- Each layer of the hierarchy is referred to as a "segment"
		- Top-level is the Root Segment (or "Level 1")
		- Each segment can have multiple Child Segments
		- Each relationship between a parent and child are known as "segment occurrences"
		- There can be up to 15 levels in a given database
	- Each segment has one or more "fields"
	- Each "row" within a segment is referred to as an "instance"
	-
- # Database Types (and supported )
	- There are many types of Hierarchical Databases:
