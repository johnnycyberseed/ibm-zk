## Summary
	- Unix **interactive shell session** (e.g., `bash`, `zsh`) ≈ z/OS [[TSO]]/E logon session
	- Shell process (PID, controlling tty) ≈ TSO logon [[address space]] / LOGONID / LU (terminal)
- ## How the analogy works
	- Present a command-line interface
		- Unix: shell prompt reads, parses, executes user commands
		- z/OS: TSO READY prompt accept CLIST / REXX / TSO commands
	- Maintain per-user environment
		- Unix: environment variables, current working directory, ulimits, UID/GID
		- z/OS: LOGONID, profile datasets, PREFIX, DATASET allocations, security context (RACF)
	- Act as interactive front-end for launching work
		- Unix: `fork`/`exec` to run programs, background `&`, pipelines, job control
		- z/OS: `CALL` or `EXEC` to run load modules, `SUBMIT` to launch batch jobs, multiple [[address space]]s via STARTED tasks
	- Provide text editing & scripting capabilities
		- Unix: editors like `vi`, shell functions
		- z/OS: ISPF editor, REXX/CLIST scripting inside the session
	- I/O routed through a terminal device
		- Unix: pseudo-tty or physical tty
		- z/OS: 3270 LU or tn3270 session mapped to the TSO [[address space]]
- ## How the analogy breaks down
	- Hosting model
		- Unix shell is just another user process; killing it ends the session
		- TSO/E session owns a dedicated address space managed by [[VTAM]] & [[JES]]; logging off terminates the entire address space, freeing datasets & control blocks
	- Multiprogramming visibility
		- Unix shell shows child PIDs and allows `fg`/`bg`
		- TSO commands run either in the same address space or spawn separate initiators; limited traditional job control
	- Terminal capabilities
		- Unix: ANSI/VT100 streams with continuous scrolling
		- 3270: screen-oriented, field-formatted I/O; input sent on ENTER/PF keys
	- Resource allocation
		- Unix: open files consume file descriptors; limits are per process
		- TSO: dynamic dataset allocation (`ALLOC`), region size limits, enqueues handled by MVS
	- Scripting language scope
		- Unix shell syntax is built into the shell process itself
		- TSO/E relies on external interpreters (CLIST, REXX) that run as command processors inside the session
