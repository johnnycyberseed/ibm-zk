- a [[IMS DB/HALDB]] containing metadata about an IMS installation
-
- Introduced in IMS v12
- It's technically optional
	- required when,
		- you're accessing IMS data from Java programs or .NET
		- using IMS DB versioning
		- using IMS native SQL support for COBOL
		- using IMS-managed ACBs
		  id:: 68824ee0-2573-4503-b539-958e4aabe1d4
		- using DDL (which requires ((68824ee0-2573-4503-b539-958e4aabe1d4)))
	- as late as 2022, there are still some non-trival number of IMS installs that are _not_ using the catalog
	- when you don't use the catalog, you're reliant on DBD
- implemented as a [[IMS DB/HALDB]]
	- specifically a [[IMS DB/PHIDAM]] in [[Data Set/Type/OSAM]]s
	- defined with 4 DSGs
	- has one secondary index: PSBs for a specific user database
- Has an extensive [[IMS/Catalog/Hierarchy]]
-
- Contains metadata:
	- for each database,
		- the [[IMS/segment]]s and their (hierarchical) relationships
		- for each [[IMS/segment]], it's key field
	- external data types of fields
	- routines to transform incoming data to the storage format (and back again)
	- the date/time pattern
-
- Not to be confused with the [[IMS/Repository]]
