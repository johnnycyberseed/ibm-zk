- Database Recovery Control facility
-
- Runs in its own address space, but is subordinate to the [[IMS/IMSCTL]].
- required by all online IMS systems
- records information about database usage (maintenance) to support recovery
	- to [[IMS/RECON]] datasets
	- when was the database last backed up?
	- when was it organized, last?
- enforces certain rules to ensure that the database (and in fact the system as a whole) is always recover-able.
	- e.g. after reorganizing  an IMS DB, DBRC will prevent updates until a backup is taken.
