- a standard JCL procedure that provides a high-level interface into executing in [[IMS/DB Batch Environment]]
-
- MBR= name of the application program
- PSB= the [[IMS/PSB]]
- Ultimately invokes [[DFSRRC00]]
-
- IBM provides a template
	- https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/ims/15.4.0?topic=environments-dlibatch-procedure
	- which sites customize
		- to define site-wide ISM
-
- DONE Unpack the mystery of the similarly named PSB from [[AmHat]].
	- The JCL mechanics for executing a procedure like DLIBATCH (i.e. that itself invokes a program handing _that_ a program to execute.)
