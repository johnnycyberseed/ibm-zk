- # Writing REXX programs
	- It's convention to start the first line of the program with a comment that begins with the string "REXX"
		- ```
		  /* REXX program that copies the contents of a GDG */
		  ...
		  ```
			- this is not technically required (at least in a TSO/E exection)
	- ## Stems (Arrays)
		- REXX does not have native support for array data structures
		- Stems fill this role

- # Running REXX programs
	- [[TSO]] implementation allows REXX programs ("execs") to be run in any [[MVS]] [[address space]].
