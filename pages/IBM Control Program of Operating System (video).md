		- systems throughput
		- turnaround time
		- providing key services
	- Control Programs
		- are responsible for:
			- data management
				- device independence
				- buffered input / output
				- extensive library services (naming devices, the data that goes on them, and how they are organized)
			- task management
				- allocating resources to independent tasks (i.e. programs)
				- identifying tasks
		- have these characteristics:
			- are _modular_ â€” can be composed of individual parts
			- compatible across models of computers
