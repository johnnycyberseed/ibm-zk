- # Summary
	- An hour-long lecture covering the theory behind the control system within the [[S/360]] achieving these goals:
		- maximize _systems throughput_ — the amount of total work that can be achieved within a certain time given the current resources
		- minimize _turnaround time_ — the time from the moment the job enters the machine shop and the results are ready
		- providing key services —
- # Maximizing Systems Throughput
	- minimizing transition times
		- by encouraging job authors to use "standard" input and output data sources
	- anticipating and resolving dependencies
		- buffering inputs and outputs before the data is needed
	-
		-
- Control Programs
	- are responsible for:
		- data management
			- device independence
			- buffered input / output
			- extensive library services (naming devices, the data that goes on them, and how they are organized)
		- task management
			- allocating resources to independent tasks (i.e. programs)
			- identifying tasks
			- supporting scheduling tasks
	- have these characteristics:
		- _modular_ — can be composed of individual parts
		- _compatible_ — works without change across models of computers
		- "processors" (i.e. individual programs) can be safely ignorant of resource management
		- _protection_ — prevent one task from clobbering the resources of another task
		- _complete and flexible_ — the identified structure is considered future proof
