- # Summary
	- An hour-long lecture covering the theory behind the control system within the [[S/360]] achieving these goals:
		- maximize _systems throughput_ — the amount of total work that can be achieved
		- minimize _turnaround time_
		- providing key services
	- Control Programs
		- are responsible for:
			- data management
				- device independence
				- buffered input / output
				- extensive library services (naming devices, the data that goes on them, and how they are organized)
			- task management
				- allocating resources to independent tasks (i.e. programs)
				- identifying tasks
				- supporting scheduling tasks
		- have these characteristics:
			- _modular_ — can be composed of individual parts
			- _compatible_ — works without change across models of computers
			- "processors" (i.e. individual programs) can be safely ignorant of resource management
			- _protection_ — prevent one task from clobbering the resources of another task
			- _complete and flexible_ — the identified structure is considered future proof
