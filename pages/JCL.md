- Job Control Language
- IBM invented JCL (first as part of [[OS/360]])
	- Fundamentally it was to automate the job of an Operator:
		- Given...
			- a set of work (aka " [[Job]] "s)
			- the input data and output data of each of those "Job"s
				- including where and how they are stored.
		- determine the optimal data mount and execution order.
		- see [[IBM Form C28-6539-x â€” 360 Job Control Language (manual)]]
