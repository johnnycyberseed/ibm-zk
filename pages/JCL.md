- Job Control Language
- IBM invented JCL (first as part of [[OS/360]])
	- Fundamentally it was to automate the job of an Operator:
		- Given
			- set of work (aka "Job"s), determine the optimal execution
		- Given the corresponding set of data
		- Where exactly the required data is either stored or will be stored (channel, unit, volume, etc.)
