- IBM introduced [[z/OS/HCD]] , a full-screen interactive tool to manage I/O definitions, and by MVS/ESA SP5 (circa 1994) **all device configuration had to be done via HCD**.
- The old method of defining I/O devices by assembling SYS1.NCP macros (MVSCP) was eliminated.
- ## Impact
	- This meant operators/sysprogs no longer hand-coded IO definition source
	- instead they use IODF databases and can even activate changes dynamically (a radically different process from the MVS 3.8 era’s static sysgen).
