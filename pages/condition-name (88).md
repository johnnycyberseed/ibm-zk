- a named value of a [[COBOL variable/condition variable]]
- colloquially: "88-level condition"
-
- ## Origins
	- lifted almost verbatim from [[COMTRAN]]
	  collapsed:: true
		- src: https://retrocomputing.stackexchange.com/questions/31713/how-widespread-was-cobols-concept-of-a-condition-name
- ## Purpose
	- Where there is a closed set of possible values for a variable,
		- there are a class of errors avoided
			- using the wrong literal value in one of the many locations it is named
			- writing the wrong boolean expression when there are multiple values involved.
		- through the use of condition-name's
			- the literals are DRY'ed up to a single declaration
			- the boolean expressions are captured in a single declaration
- ## Notes
	- why "88"?
		- The [[CODASYL]] team design level numbers in decades:
			- 01..49 :: structure
			- 66 :: renames
			- 77 :: stand-alone items
		- at that time in the design process, "88" was the next available slot
			- it also makes it easy to spot in a listing
	- diff: enums typically have a single value per named condition; in COBOL a condition-name can specify multiple values and range of values.
