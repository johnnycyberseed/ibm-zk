- a named value of a [[COBOL variable/condition variable]]
- colloquially: "88-level item"
-
- ## Origins
	- lifted almost verbatim from [[COMTRAN]]
- ## Purpose
	- Where there is a closed set of possible values for a variable,
		- there are a class of errors avoided
			-
		- through the use of [[condition-name (88)]]s
- ## Notes
	- why "88"?
		- The [[CODASYL]] team design level numbers in decades:
			- 01..49 :: structure
			- 66 :: renames
			- 77 :: stand-alone items
		- at that time in the design process, "88" was the next available slot
			- it also makes it easy to spot in a listing
